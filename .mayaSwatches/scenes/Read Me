This is my Robot Arm Prototype that I am currently working on. Ideally I would like to have it be a ocean life styled robot arm as I think that would look really cool. Some of the struggles that I have 
Currently run into with this project is getting the joints set up and connected to the mesh as I built the model first before doing joints and am struggling to connect the two.
